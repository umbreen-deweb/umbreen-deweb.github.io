        <h5> Short Bio</h5>
        <em>My name is Amber. I have been painting for a long time. I still remember when I signed up for my first painting class in community college. I was shocked how expensive it was to buy supplies. I was certain this class would not lead to much, but I was excited about playing with colors. Who doesn't like to get their hands dirty with paint, we've all finger painted as some point, its liberating. I took the class and eureka! Art is AWESOME! Twenty years later, still painting. It's therapy. It's happy. It's expression without words! </em>
