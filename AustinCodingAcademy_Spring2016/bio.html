            <h5>Why Coding? </h5>
             I am here to use my creativity and chanel it to the digital world and connect and create connections through websites and mobile apps.
            My inspiration is the nature of things, beings and the extraordinary talent that surrounds, humbles and inspires me. Hard work knows no bounds. I love what beliving in one self, presistence, company of supportive peers and humility can do for a person.

            <h5> Why Art?</h5>
            My name is Amber. I have been painting for a long time. I still remember when I signed up for my first painting class in community college. I was shocked how expensive it was to buy supplies. I was certain this class would not lead to much, but I was excited about playing with colors. Who doesn't like to get their hands dirty with paint, we've all finger painted as some point, its liberating. I took the class and eureka! Art is AWESOME! Twenty years later, still painting. It's therapy. It's happy. It's expression without words!

            <h3> More of this... </h3>
            <p>
             &asymp; Abstract Painting -  I love the freedom of expression it gives you. It is boundless and each stroke is unique to the artist and their emotion.
                 &asymp; Travel -  I love how much it can broaden your mind, enrich your life. To meet new people, to feel helpless at the hands of a new language. Its humbling and various levels of amazing.  
             &asymp; Code - an happy addiction. To teach a machine to do exactly as I code. It's exjilarating. 
            &asymp; Netflix - I just love it, enough said. 
           </p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="list">
            <h3> Not so much...</h3>
              &asymp;Birds -  they don't like me. Feeling is mutual.
              &asymp;Dishonesty -  it ruins a perfectly good uneventful day.
                &asymp; Greed -  its kryptonite with a capital K.
                &asymp; Ending to 'Lost' - hundred of hours invested and for THAT.
                 &asymp; Pesimissim - the glass maynot be half full and but it doesn't have to half empty either, it could just be on hold for a refill !
