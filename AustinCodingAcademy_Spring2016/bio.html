            <h5> Why Art?</h5>
            My name is Amber. I have been painting for a long time. I still remember when I signed up for my first painting class in community college. I was shocked how expensive it was to buy supplies. I was certain this class would not lead to much, but I was excited about playing with colors. Who doesn't like to get their hands dirty with paint, we've all finger painted as some point, its liberating. I took the class and eureka! Art is AWESOME! Twenty years later, still painting. It's therapy. It's happy. It's expression without words!

            <h3> DOs </h3>
            <p>
             &asymp; Abstract Painting -  I love the freedom of expression it gives you. It is boundless and each stroke is unique to the artist and their emotion.
                 &asymp; Travel -  I love how much it can broaden your mind, enrich your life. To meet new people, to feel helpless at the hands of a new language. Its humbling and various levels of amazing.  
             &asymp; Code - an happy addiction. To teach a machine to do exactly as I code. It's exjilarating. 
            &asymp; Netflix - I just love it, enough said. 
           </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
            <h3> DON'Ts</h3>
              &asymp;Birds -  they don't like me. Feeling is mutual.
              &asymp;Dishonesty -  it ruins a perfectly good uneventful day.
                &asymp; Greed -  its kryptonite with a capital K.
                &asymp; Ending to 'Lost' - hundred of hours invested and for THAT.
                 &asymp; Pesimissim - the glass maynot be half full and but it doesn't have to half empty either, it could just be on hold for a refill !
