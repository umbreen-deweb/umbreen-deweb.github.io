                    <p>Mack Marsh, was named the Project Director of Access Empowerment on April 1, 2012 and is responsible for the daily operations of the parking Mobility program to end accessible parking abuse.  Before coming to Access Empowerment, Mack was the Executive Director of the Texas Association of Centers for Independent Living (TACIL). Prior to coming to Texas to lead TACIL, Mack was a life-long resident of Louisiana where he owned a successful wholesale company for 13 years. In 2001, Mack experienced a spinal cord injury resulting in quadriplegia. After his injury, Mack worked as an Independent Living Specialist at New Horizons Independent Living Center (NHILC) in Shreveport, LA. In 2002, Mack was named Director of IL at NHILC. He was instrumental in helping secure equipment and funding to address the critical needs of people with disabilities following hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, helping to raise and distribute over $6.5 million in durable medical equipment. In 2007, Mack turned his attentions to injury prevention becoming the Marketing Director for ThinkFirst, the National Injury Prevention Program. In two years with ThinkFirst, Mack educated over 400,000 youth and young adults on how to prevent traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. In 2009 and 2010, Mack was the director of the Louisiana Medicaid Infrastructure Grant, tripling the grant’s income and helping leverage in excess of $8 million for non-profit organizations providing supports and services toward employment for people with disabilities and helping over 6,000 people go to work.

Mack’s younger son is a high school student and aspiring baseball star.  On any given weekend, Mack and the boys can be found at any local fishing spot, camping in the great outdoors or on an adventure pushing the boundaries of their abilities.  Since Mack’s injury, he and the boys have planned a different adventure every year, the only requirement is that it has to include something they haven’t done before.</p>

                    <p>Colton Reed  joined the Air Force delayed enlistment program when I was 17 as he wanted to serve his country. After completing his training, he moved into his first station, Beale AFB in April 2008. Working in the intelligence career field, he found some unique opportunities like saving eight American citizens lives. He found a passion in making a difference in the world and believes it is one of the greatest feelings someone can have. He was medically retired as a Senior Airman from the military. He has been able to enact change in many places through his desire to be an advocate for victims. While still in the military, he fought to ensure that members in the Air Force, which were not wounded during combat, were able to test for promotion.  He also fought to get much needed changes in military housing for disabled veterans on Ft. Sam Houston.  He is currently attending school full time and will graduate with his bachelors from Texas State in May 2016, completing his entire degree in 3 ½ years. Colton is also applying for law school for the fall 2016 Semester. "While I have been through a lot in my young life, I have not let my challenges stop me from achieving great things."</p>
